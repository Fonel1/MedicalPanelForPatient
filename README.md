# MedicalPanelForPatient
In this repository you will find my generic MedPan project. It is an mHealth application that gives users the ability to make an appointment, send an image of medical test results to the doctor for diagnosis.
In the video below, you can see how these apps work and how they communicate with each other. On the left is the patient app and on the right is the doctor app.
